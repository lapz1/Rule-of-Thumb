# Rule-of-Thumb

Hi, first of all I like to thanks for the oppotunity to be a part of Zemoga, I must say that one of the biggest challenges of this type of technical test is TIME 'cause I'm working from monday to saturday, but I still tried to do my best to show my programming skills.

The project was done in three stages. The first one, was the Backend that can be consult on the INTERACTIVE branch, the second one was the Frontend that is on the LAYOUT branch and finally a merge with the MASTER.

# INTERACTIVE

The backend was programmed in Javascript with NodeJS and Express, the idea was to create a database to save and preserve data information so I used MongoDB.

For installation follow the next steps.

  - Download or clone the backend folder.
  - Open the NodeJS console go to source folder and execute the command: npm install
  - For launch the application execute the command: node index.js


# LAYOUT

The frontend was programmed in Javascript with NodeJS, React and SASS. Also I download and user de Lato Font from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato

For installation follow the next steps.

  - Download or clone the frontend folder.
  - Open the NodeJS console go to source folder and execute the command: npm install
  - For launch the application execute the command: npm start

# MASTER

Actually I still working on the merge application.


Thaks again, I really like to be part of your team, hope to see you soon!!!
