# Rule-of-Thumb

Hi, first of all I like to thanks for the oppotunity to be a part of Zemoga, I must say that one of the biggest challenges of this type of technical test is TIME 'cause I'm working from monday to saturday, but I still tried to do my best to show my programming skills.

The project was done in three stages. The first one, was the Backend that can be consulted on the INTERACTIVE branch, the second one was the Frontend that is on the LAYOUT branch and finally a merge with the MASTER.

# INTERACTIVE

The backend was programmed in Javascript with NodeJS and Express, the idea was to create a database to save and preserve data information so I used MongoDB.

For installation follow the next steps.

  - Download or clone the backend folder.
  - Open the NodeJS console go to source folder and execute the command: npm install
  - For launch the application execute the command: node index.js

The env file was sent by email, this has the database settings.

# LAYOUT

The frontend was programmed in Javascript with NodeJS, React and SASS. Also I download and user de Lato Font from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato

For installation follow the next steps.

  - Download or clone the frontend folder.
  - Open the NodeJS console go to source folder and execute the command: npm install
  - For launch the application execute the command: npm start

The env file was sent by email, this has the backend url.

# MASTER

The master is a combination between the frontend and the backend, you have to run the INTERACTIVE and the LAYOUT at the same time.

To use the APP, follow the steps below.

  - Register (Sign up Form)
  - Login (Sign in Form)
  - Vote (By clicking on the Thumb Up or Down button) NOTE: Header Thumb button still on development
